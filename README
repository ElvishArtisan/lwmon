This is the README file for the lwmon package.

LWMon is a small set of monitoring and information tools for LiveWire
protocols. It includes the following utilities:

lwaddr(1) - A command-line lookup tool for translating LiveWire audio
            stream address values between various formats, including IPv4,
            MAC and LiveWire stream numbers.

lwcast(1) - A GUI utility for manually adding and removing subscriptions
            to IPv4 multicast groups. Mostly useful in conjunction with
            a packet monitor such as WireShark.

lwcp(1) - A GUI utility for monitoring and controlling LiveWire devices
          via LiveWire Control Protocol (LWCP)

lwrp(1) - A GUI utility for monitoring and controlling LiveWire devices
          via LiveWire Control Protocol (LWRP)
