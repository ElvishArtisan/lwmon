This is the README file for the lwmon package.

LWMon is a small set of monitoring and information tools for LiveWire
protocols. It includes the following utilities:

lwaddr(1) - A CLI lookup tool for translating LiveWire audio stream address
            values between various formats, including IPv4, MAC and LiveWire
            stream numbers.

lwcap(1) - A CLI utility for capturing Livewire RTP streams.

lwcast(1) - A GUI utility for manually adding and removing subscriptions
            to IPv4 multicast groups. Mostly useful in conjunction with
            a packet monitor such as WireShark.

lwcp(1) - A GUI utility for monitoring and controlling LiveWire devices
          via LiveWire Control Protocol (LWCP)

lwmaster(8) - A CLI utility for determining the current address of the
              master clock node in a Livewire network.

lwmastermon(1) - A GUI applet for continuously displaying the current
                 address of the master clock node in a Livewire network.

lwmultcap(1) - A CLI utility for monitoring and printing multicast
               messages.

lwrp(1) - A GUI utility for monitoring and controlling LiveWire devices
          via LiveWire Control Protocol (LWRP)
